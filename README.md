# üé∂ Thaapasakhi

## Basic Details

### Team Name: MegaMinds

### Team Members
- Team Lead: Mohammed Fahad - Government Engineering College Palakkad
- Member 2: N Fadeela - Government Engineering College Palakkad
- Member 3: Mohammed Muflih - Government Engineering College Palakkad

### Project Description
A beautiful flawless project which plays songs according to the subjected temperature üòâ

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Nobody loves to sense the surrounding temperature by themselves. Do they?
So, we made this complicated facade to help you with that üòå

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We collect data from a temperature sensor and plays accurate melodies for you üé∂

## Technical Details
### Technologies/Components Used
For Software:
- Languages used: Javascript & CPP
- Framework ysed: Arduino & Node.JS
- Libraries used: Audic, ws, dht11,ESP8266WiFi.h,WiFiClient.h
- Tools used: Arduino IDE, Zed, Audacity

For Hardware:
- Components:
  - NodeMCU v1 (ESP8266)
  - DHT11 temperature sensor

### Implementation
1. Read data from DHT11 sensor
2. Send the data to [ntfy](https://ntfy.sh)
3. On the PC, establish a web socket to ntfy api.
4. Checking the temperatures, and playing specified audio files

# Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/Ranger-NF/Thaapasakhi/
cd Thaapasakhi
```

- Server:
```
cd src/server
npm install
```

- NodeMCU:
  - Open `src/mircrocontroller/main/main.ino` file in Arduino IDE
  - Connect NodeMCU board and upload the code


# Run
- Server:
  ```
  cd src/server
  node index.js
  ```

- NodeMCU: Just connect it to power
